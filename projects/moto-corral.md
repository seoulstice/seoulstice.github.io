title: 'Motorcycle Corral Finder'
---

This is a placeholder page for a Motorcycle Corral Finder application that is currently in production.  The application will be built on a Rails API with a Vue.js frontend and will allow a User to find motorcycle parking corrals in one of two ways:  
1. Closest parking corral to current location
2. Closest parking corral to an address
